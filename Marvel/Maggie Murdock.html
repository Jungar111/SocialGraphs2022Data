She and Jack had Matt when they were a young couple, but Maggie soon suffered from <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Postpartum_depression" title="Postpartum depression" id="mwIw">postpartum depression</a>, having doubts, feeling constantly anxious regarding Matt's safety, thoughts which soon developed into self-loathing, feeling estranged, as she considered herself to be a bad mother. Eventually her depression led to <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Paranoia" title="Paranoia" id="mwJA">paranoia</a>, which was revealed to be post-natal depression. She began losing control of herself and started thinking that Jack was plotting against her, and that Matt was there to tear them apart. One night, under the influence of her mental illness, Maggie tried to assault the baby. Jack managed to stop her; Maggie broke down and hugged her husband not knowing what to do with her illness that she brought to the family. As soon as she came to her senses, she finally realized that she needed to leave for her husband and son's sakes. She soon packed her bags and ran from home, where she was taken in by a church, becoming a nun and started going by Sister Margaret. With the help of doctors and counseling, she recovered from her depression. She never came back to the Murdock residence because she didn't want to take the chance of threatening them again.<sup about="#mwt15" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-dd230_1-1" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{"name":"dd230"},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-dd230-1"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-dd230-1" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 1;" id="mwJQ"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwJg">[1]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt16" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-dd229_2-2" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{"name":"dd229"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-dd229-2" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 2;" id="mwJw"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwKA">[2]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt17" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-3" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-3"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-3" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 3;" id="mwKQ"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwKg">[3]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt18" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-4" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-4"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-4" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 4;" id="mwKw"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwLA">[4]</span></a></sup></p>

<p id="mwLQ">As an adult, Matt reunited with Maggie during a time when Kingpin, having learned that Matt was Daredevil, engineered the ruin of his life on several levels. Nearly broken after trying to get revenge, Murdock was taken in by Sister Maggie and with his enhanced senses, immediately felt the connection between them but he never knew that she was his mother. However, when he asked her flatly if she was his mother, Maggie calmly smiled and denied this but in her heart she couldn't believe that she had a reunion with her son but didn't know how to tell him the truth. Matt, who had 'read' Maggie's reaction to his question with his abilities, knew she was lying, but not why. During this period of recovery, Maggie also briefly met Matt's friend and ally, <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Spider-Man" title="Spider-Man" id="mwLg">Spider-Man</a>, who was shocked by how broken Matt was. For some time after, Maggie was a figure in Matt's life.</p>
 
<p id="mwLw">Years later, while caring for a baby girl he suspected of being the Antichrist, he almost threw the baby off the roof of building trying to kill it but soon realized he was wrong and plunged off the roof, saving her and himself, ending up in front of the Church where Sister Maggie lived. Daredevil brought her to Sister Maggie at the Clinton Mission Shelter and slept for two days in her room. While he slept, she cleaned his costume and cared for the infant. When Matt woke up, Maggie greeted him and offered him some food. After talking, Matt got her to finally admit that she was his mother. She noted the similarities between him and his father, but told him she had no answers for why she had left him so many years before. When he questioned all the problems he had had in life and told her that God had let her off pretty easily, she slapped him across the face, and he dropped to his knees and apologized. They talked for hours about Maggie's life before becoming a nun, she then encouraged him to ask God for answers about the baby, telling him that after all of his experiences in the supernatural that he should have no problem believing in God. He questioned how she could be so confident in her faith, and she told him a story about a knight and a monk. Maggie then advised Matt to talk to <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Karen_Page" title="Karen Page" id="mwMA">Karen Page</a>, who was waiting for him downstairs in the sanctuary.</p>

<p id="mwMQ">Matt soon went out as Daredevil again and met up with <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Dr._Strange" title="Dr. Strange" class="mw-redirect" id="mwMg">Dr. Strange</a> to find out if <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Mephisto_(comics)" title="Mephisto (comics)" class="mw-redirect" id="mwMw">Mephisto</a> had any involvement with the baby, and soon battled with <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Bullseye_(comics)" title="Bullseye (comics)" class="mw-redirect" id="mwNA">Bullseye</a>, sent by <a rel="mw:WikiLink" href="./Mysterio" title="Mysterio" id="mwNQ">Mysterio</a> to retrieve the baby, at the Shelter. Maggie and the others refused to tell him where the baby was, so he killed Maggie's fellow nuns' Sister Theresa and tortured Sister Anne, but Maggie kept the baby hidden. When Daredevil returned, Maggie told him what happened, and then Bullseye appeared and attacked him. While the two battled, Karen Page showed up soon after, Maggie and Karen spoke quietly thinking of a plan and offered the baby to Bullseye in exchange for not killing Daredevil, whom he had shot and now had at his mercy. Karen tricked him, delivering a baby doll instead, while Maggie tried to escape out the door with the real baby. Bullseye dropped Karen with the doll and then snatched the real baby from Maggie and raised Daredevil's Billy club to kill Karen, but Karen had grabbed his discarded gun and demanded he stop. Bullseye mocked her, as the gun only had a single bullet, doubting that she could aim it right and pull the trigger; he then hurled the billy club at Daredevil to kill him instead, but Karen leaped into its path and was killed when it went through her chest. After that Bullseye took the baby and left. Daredevil soon tracked down the baby to Mysterio, who revealed he had drugged Daredevil making him hallucinate about the baby being the antichrist to try to break him using the baby to manipulate him. Eventually Daredevil overcame him and saved the baby, while Mysterio committed suicide in the process.</p>

<p id="mwNg">Maggie met up with Matt at the hospital where he visited the baby girl making sure the baby was looked after; Maggie herself was still banged up from her recent trauma and using a walking stick for support. They discussed everything that happened and what the baby means to Matt and how Mysterio's attacks affected him. Maggie told Matt that the authorities had arranged for the baby to be adopted and said the baby needed a name. Matt suggested calling her Karen in Karen Page's honor. Maggie finally confessed why she left, she didn't leave because of herself, she left for the sakes of her husband and her son, she felt that she is no good to anyone. Maggie was emotional and she was so sorry that she hadn't been there for her son Matt. Matt and Maggie hugged and reconciled. Maggie later attended Karen's funeral and comforted her son and she wanted Matt's permission to be a part of her son's life from then on.<sup about="#mwt32" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-dd229_2-3" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{"name":"dd229"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-dd229-2" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 2;" id="mwNw"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwOA">[2]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt33" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-5" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-5"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-5" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 5;" id="mwOQ"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwOg">[5]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt34" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-6" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-6"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-6" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 6;" id="mwOw"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwPA">[6]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt35" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-7" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-7"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-7" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 7;" id="mwPQ"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwPg">[7]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt36" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-8" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-8"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-8" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 8;" id="mwPw"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwQA">[8]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt37" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-9" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-9"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-9" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 9;" id="mwQQ"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwQg">[9]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt38" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-10" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-10"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-10" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 10;" id="mwQw"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwRA">[10]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt39" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-11" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-11"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-11" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 11;" id="mwRQ"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwRg">[11]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt40" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-12" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-12"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-12" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 12;" id="mwRw"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwSA">[12]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt41" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-13" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-13"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-13" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 13;" id="mwSQ"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwSg">[13]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt42" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-14" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-14"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-14" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 14;" id="mwSw"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwTA">[14]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt43" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-15" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-15"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-15" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 15;" id="mwTQ"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwTg">[15]</span></a></sup><sup about="#mwt44" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-16" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref" data-mw='{"name":"ref","attrs":{},"body":{"id":"mw-reference-text-cite_note-16"}}'><a href="./Maggie_Murdock#cite_note-16" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 16;" id="mwTw"><span class="mw-reflink-text" id="mwUA">[16]</span></a></sup></p>
